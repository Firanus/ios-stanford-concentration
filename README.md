# Developing iOS 11 Apps With Swift - Concentration app

This is an implementation of the Concentration app used to introduce students to Swift in the Stanford course 'Developing iOS 11 Apps with Swift'. It plays the game [Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)).

Note that releases of this app are designed to keep it in line with the lectures and programming assignments. If you are following the course yourself, then feel free to treat these releases as approximate milestones as to the state of the app.
